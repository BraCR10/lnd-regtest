# Mostro (P2P exchange)

[Mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro) is a P2P Bitcoin trading daemon over the Nostr protocol. It runs on lnd1 and connects to external Nostr relays (default: `wss://nos.lol`, `wss://relay.mostro.network`).

## Building from source

Mostro is **built from source** (not pulled from Docker Hub). The setup script:

1. Clones the [Mostro repo](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro) into `mostro-src/` (or runs `git pull` if it already exists)
2. Builds the Docker image locally using `docker/Dockerfile` from the repo
3. Tags it as `mostro:local`

This ensures you always run the latest `main` branch. The first build takes a few minutes (Rust compilation). Subsequent runs of `setup.sh` will pull the latest changes and rebuild.

You can override the repo URL via `MOSTRO_REPO` in `.env`.

## Nostr key

Mostro needs a Nostr identity (nsec private key). The script handles this in three ways:

1. **From `.env`** — set `MOSTRO_NSEC_PRIVKEY=nsec1...` to skip prompts entirely
2. **Interactive prompt** — paste your existing nsec key when asked
3. **Auto-generate with rana** — press Enter at the prompt to build [rana](https://github.com/grunch/rana) and generate a new keypair (first build takes a few minutes)

The private key is saved to `mostro/nostr-private.txt` (chmod 600). The public key (npub) is displayed on screen at the end of setup.

## File locations

```
mostro/
├── settings.toml       # generated — Mostro configuration
├── nostr-private.txt   # nsec key (chmod 600)
└── lnd/
    ├── tls.cert        # copied from lnd1

```

All files under `mostro/` are generated by the script and git-ignored.
