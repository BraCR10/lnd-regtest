# Mostro (P2P exchange)

[Mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro) is a P2P Bitcoin trading daemon over the Nostr protocol. It runs on lnd1 and uses a local Nostr relay.

## Nostr key

Mostro needs a Nostr identity (nsec private key). The script handles this in three ways:

1. **From `.env`** — set `MOSTRO_NSEC_PRIVKEY=nsec1...` to skip prompts entirely
2. **Interactive prompt** — paste your existing nsec key when asked
3. **Auto-generate with rana** — press Enter at the prompt to build [rana](https://github.com/grunch/rana) and generate a new keypair (first build takes a few minutes)

The private key is saved to `mostro/nostr-private.txt` (chmod 600). The public key (npub) is displayed on screen at the end of setup.

## File locations
